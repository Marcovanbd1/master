        <h1>The Governance Protocol</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            This document outlines the ethical and technical framework that underpins <strong>Mood</strong>, ensuring safety, privacy, and actionable insight at scale.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Zero-Data Architecture</h2>
        <p>Our core commitment is to remove all data liability for our <strong>Integration Partners</strong> (Rapid Health, NHS, Enterprise) and all privacy risk for the user.</p>
        
        <p><strong>No Logins/Accounts:</strong> The user is anonymous by design.</p>
        <p><strong>Ephemeral Input:</strong> All natural language input is processed instantly and deleted immediately after the Playlist is generated. Nothing is stored.</p>
        <p><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We operate without cookies, session tracking, or IP logging.</p>
        <p><strong>GDPR Shield:</strong> By eliminating Personally Identifiable Information (PII) collection, we remove the primary compliance risks associated with user data storage.</p>

        <h2>2. ANCI: Autonomous Non-Clinical Intelligence</h2>
        <p>ANCI is the proprietary logic engine that translates unstructured emotional text into structured, actionable navigational steps.</p>

        <p><strong>Navigation, Not Diagnosis:</strong> The model is trained <strong>only</strong> to identify needs (housing, debt, social support, self-care) and never to diagnose clinical conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Operational Safety:</strong> This focus de-risks deployment. We operate strictly as an intelligent routing layer, removing the regulatory burden associated with AI as a Medical Device (AIaMD).</p>
        <p><strong>Peer-Validation:</strong> ANCI’s routing logic is trained and refined against a library of peer-validated support pathways.</p>

        <h2>3. DSI: Demand Shaping Intelligence</h2>
        <p>DSI is the aggregated, anonymized data stream that provides system-level insight. This is the only information our infrastructure retains.</p>

        <p><strong>Anonymous Aggregation:</strong> We aggregate sentiment (e.g., "high volume of anxiety mentioning housing debt") and time stamps. No user inputs or identities are retained.</p>
        <p><strong>Civic Radar:</strong> This data acts as an early warning system, allowing leaders to commission resources proactively based on real-time population stress signals.</p>

        <h2>4. Oversight & Scope</h2>
        <p>To maintain trust and technical rigor, our platform is subject to continuous review.</p>

        <p><strong>Safety Review:</strong> External advisors constantly test the model output to ensure safe routing and prevent navigational drift.</p>
        <p><strong>Regulatory Alignment:</strong> Mood is an <strong>intelligent navigation utility</strong>, not a medical device. We do not diagnose, treat, or prescribe. We align with the highest standards of Data Ethics and Safe Routing to ensure that non-clinical demand is resolved effectively while clinical needs are clearly signposted.</p>
